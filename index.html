				<p> Hello fellow De-Buggers, first time poster here. "To stop catching 'flies, is what we will decide, Ra, Ra!" And all that. I've been butterfly free for almost 2 months now, and I have to say it has been the hardest 2 months of my life. But the end is in sight, and each day I feel a little stronger, like a ... emerging from a ...  nevermind. The reason I am posting today is that even with the bi weekly meetings and the support of the community I am worried I will relapse into catching those sweet, sweet butterflies. I can still feel the smooth bamboo handle of my customized butterfly net in my hand, even though I disposed of it weeks ago... Anyways. I have decided I am finally strong enough to begin working again, and I think it will be extremely helpful to keep my mind off of butterflies. It is time for me to unfurl my wings and flutter off like a... there I go again. Anyways, a little about myself ... <a href = "page2.html" > (View this Post) </a></p>
