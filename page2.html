				<p> Hello fellow De-Buggers, first time poster here. "To stop catching 'flies, is what we will decide, Ra, Ra!" And all that. I've been butterfly free for almost 2 months now, and I have to say it has been the hardest 2 months of my life. But the end is in sight, and each day I feel a little stronger, like a ... emerging from a ...  nevermind. The reason I am posting today is that even with the bi weekly meetings and the support of the community I am worried I will relapse into catching those sweet, sweet butterflies. I can still feel the smooth bamboo handle of my customized butterfly net in my hand, even though I disposed of it weeks ago... Anyways. I have decided I am finally strong enough to begin working again, and I think it will be extremely helpful to keep my mind off of butterflies. It is time for me to unfurl my wings and flutter off like a... there I go again. Anyways, a little about myself ... </p>

				<p> Here are some pictures of me in my prime butterfly catching days. As you can see in the top photo I am handling an eastern sriped Moth and in the bottom I am releasing a Blue Grass Butterfly back into its natural habitat. I know I shouldn't be sharing butterfly photos but unfortunately those are those are the only picures I have of myself. </p>

				<p> Like most of you, before I de-bugged myself I was constantly bugging out. It got to the point where family members would call me BUGS bunny, BUG's Life, or just plaing old Bugger. In my estimation I was sucked down the butterfly catching hole for approximately 2 years, most of which I only vaguely remember (Due to extreme butterfly related excitement). But before that I studied some non insect related de-bugging, and it is that knowledge which I hope will allow an employer to save me from the depths of butterfly hell. </p>
